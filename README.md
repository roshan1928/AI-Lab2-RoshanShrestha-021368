# 🔍 Heuristic Search Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of two classic heuristic search problems:

1. **8-Puzzle Problem** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** with Manhattan distance as a heuristic.
2. **Block Arrangement Problem** using **Hill Climbing** algorithm with misplaced block heuristic.

## 1️⃣ 8-Puzzle Problem (BFS with Manhattan Heuristic)

### 🧩 Problem Description
A 3x3 puzzle board with tiles numbered 1–8 and one blank tile (0). The goal is to reach the state:

- 1 2 3
- 4 5 6
- 7 8 0
